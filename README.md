# mockA
This is just a clone of the original [mockA](https://github.com/uweku/mockA), the free Mocking Framework for ABAP.

The original mockA version is available as a [SAPlink nugget](https://github.com/uweku/mockA/tree/master/mockA_build) and can be installed on a SAP System with [SAPlink](http://saplink.org).

This version can easily be installed on a SAP System with [abapGit](https://github.com/larshp/abapGit).
